== Welcome to Unify
Unify is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps manage your contacts efficiently.

=== Do More with Less
Unlike conventional Address Books, Unify adopts a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
By having a CLI, you can navigate and manage Unify efficiently by typing commands.
Commands capture the important details of your action into a concise line.
With just one line, you can traverse your large network to find your old pal John or update your Mum's phone number.
Now you can spend less time in your Address Book, and more time on what matters most to you.


=== First Time CLI User?

* Don't fret! Unify offers inline hints to prompt you what to type next,
+
image::UG_Hints.png[width="300"]
+
and will validate your input as you type. +

+
* Afraid you will accidentally delete your girlfriend's details? We've got you covered! The `undo` command lets you revert any important changes to prevent any future embarrassment/pain. +
* Still lost? You can type `help` to access the User Guide whenever you need. +
* Unify will guide you along the way so that you can turn from Novice to Master in no time! +

=== Searching for people by details: `find`

Looking for an old friend who stayed in Bishan? Identifying the person who sent you a message from his e-mail made in Primary School? Unify's `find` command allows you

e.g. `n/Hans n/Bo` will not return `Hans Gruber` or `Bo Yang` but will return `Hans Holbo`.

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g `n/hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `n/Hans n/Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* You may search for different fields by adding a prefix. ([n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG])
* If the first field is a name, you do not need a prefix. (find NAME [MORE_PREFIX/KEYWORDS]...) +
