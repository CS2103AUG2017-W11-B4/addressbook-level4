=== Do More with Less
Unify is a Command Line Interface AddressBook that helps you manage your contacts efficiently. Unlike conventional Address Books, Unify adopts a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
By having a CLI, you can navigate and manage Unify efficiently by typing commands.
Commands capture the important details of your action into a concise line.
With just one line, you can traverse your large network to find your old pal John or update your Brother's phone number.
Now you can spend less time in your Address Book, and more time on what matters most to you.


=== First Time CLI User?

* Don't fret! Unify offers inline hints to prompt you what to type next,
+
image::UG_Hints.png[width="300"]
+
and will validate your input as you type. +
+

Want to listen to some of your favourite tunes? Unify's got you covered! Unify's `music play` command plays a music track
from a specific genre from a list of built in mp3 music. If you had already paused a track, `music play` resumes playing that track. +

Format: `music play [GENRE]`

image::header_note.png[width="400"]

The genre can only be pop, dance or classic. `music play` alone will play pop songs as default.

=== Undoing previous command : `undo`
image::UG_commandheader_undo.png[width="500"]

Accidentally cleared all your contacts? Edited the wrong contact detail? Fear not! Unify's `undo` command restores the
address book to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. This is your emergency command if you
incorrectly modified Unify's contact list.+

image::UG_header_format.png[width="400"]
Format: `undo`

image::header_note.png[width="400"]

Undoable commands modify the address book's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`).

image::UG_header_examples.png[width="400"]

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`
image::UG_commandheader_redo.png[width="500"]

Just like how `undo` undoes your most recent command, `redo` reverses the most recent `undo` command. +

image::UG_header_format.png[width="400"]
Format: `redo`

image::UG_header_examples.png[width="400"]

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
