Most of us enjoy listening to music while we do our work. Hence, by having a built-in music player, users can enjoy some tunes while they adding, or editing or any other related task in Unify address book.

You may ask, "Why can't I use other streaming services such as Spotify?" Well, the reason is that this does not require internet connection, and since it is already built-in, it encourages users to use it immediately
without any second thought. Users would prefer this method as removes the hassle of requiring multiple clicks to finding a music to play by having just a single command execution to play some music.
