Most of us enjoy listening to music while we do our work. Hence, by having a built-in music player, users can enjoy some tunes while they adding, or editing or any other related task in Unify address book.

You may ask, "Why can't I use other streaming services such as Spotify?" Well, the reason is that this does not require internet connection, and since it is already built-in, it encourages users to use it immediately
without any second thought. Users would prefer this method as removes the hassle of requiring multiple clicks to finding a music to play by having just a single command execution to play some music.

It is very important to give user some form of feedback other than visual feedback. Minor audio cues can make a tremendous difference in user-experience. In Unify,

I want the users to feel that they are in control, hence I have added the typing sound that gives user the sense of every input they make is being input successfully, every characters every key press is essential.

The next audio cue I have added is the Text-To-Speech feature, specifically, this feature allows Unify to "speak" to the user. Giving a more human-like feedback to the user.
When a command is executed successfully Unify will announced that it is executed successfully. In addition, when the user selects a contact's name, Unify will say out name of the selected contact's name.

This Text-To-Speech feature was part of the initiative together with the (not yet implemented) Speech-To-Text feature to bring in users who has vision disabilities into using Unify as well. Potentially increasing our user base.

Instead of separating remarks into another command. I have decided to implement it together with add and edit command instead. This streamline the process of adding and editing a remark. Even though, this involves editing existing code base, I believe the outcome is much better than having remarks as a separate command.

Sometimes, we want another form of input. By having Speech-To-Text features implemented into Unify, we are able to give users a another form of input.

This feature could be also extremely beneficial to users that suffers from slow typing or prefer to multitask
and use their speech to execute commands instead. This feature may be also tied together with the existing Text-To-Speech feature to help users who may suffer from some form of disabilities, to give them a hands-free yet full user experience of Unify without any drawbacks.

I have tried experimenting with some Speech-To-Text codes, but I do not enough time for it to be implemented in the final product of V1.5 of Unify.

The codes can be here [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/blob/master/collated/unused/hanselblack.md[Unused code]] while the resource files can be found here [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-W11-B4/main/tree/master/unused/resources/edu/cmu/sphinx/models/en-us[Resources]]
