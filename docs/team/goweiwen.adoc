=== Enhancement Added: Alias

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=alias]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

Aliases help users execute commands they might forget. For example, if the user can't remember how to
add a new contact to the address book, they can type any of `add`, `create`, or `new`. In addition,
we allow users to define their own aliases if the default ones are not memorable enough.

We do not
provide short-form aliases (e.g. `a` as an alias for `add`) by default as we feel having a powerful
autocompletion feature completely eclipses any uses for cryptic short-form commands.
