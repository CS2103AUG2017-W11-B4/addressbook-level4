=== Enhancement Added: Find by Details

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Find by details offers a natural solution for users to search for their contacts. Most of the time, a user would not have the name of the contact
they are searching for. They may only remember the contact's home address for instance or maybe they are trying to trace a missed call. This feature
allows users to filter through the address book based on any person's details to get to the contact they are looking for.

At the same time, this feature saves time for the user. It is not uncommon to see people with the same name. By allowing an additional search field,
users are able to narrow down their search more quickly. For example, to find John who is tagged as a classmate, he can just type `find John t/classmate`
instead of searching through each and every `John` in his addressbook.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=undoredo]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `remark`

{Explain similar to the Undo/Redo feature above.}
